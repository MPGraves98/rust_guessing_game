# Guessing Game in Rust

A command-line guessing game built in Rust, inspired by *The Rust Programming Language* book tutorial. This project generates a random number between 1 and 100, asks for user input, and provides feedback on each guess (too high, too low, or correct).

### Features
- Uses Rust’s approach to variables, user input, and error management.
- Integrates the `rand` crate for random number generation.
- Demonstrates Rust basics, including Result types, match statements, and loop control.
